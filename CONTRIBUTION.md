This repository accepts pull requests from everyone. You can add ✨*whatever the hell you want*✨ to the game and it will be approved ASAP.

Rule 1: To add your own section to the game, add an outflow option like this to an existing section:
<pre>
someone's text/picture
</pre>
Existing option 1
<br>
Existing option 2
<br>
Your new option.

Each option has a brief description and one emoji that links to a section. Use this format:
```
[EMOJI HERE](#name-of-section) Description of your option.
```

Also add a `<br>` between options.

Then add the section your option leads to using this format (delete the spaces between backticks):
```
#### Name of section
<pre>
your section's text/picture
</pre>
[EMOJI HERE](#name-of-first-section) Description of first option.
<br>
[EMOJI HERE](#name-of-second-section) Description of second option.
```

Adding options to your section is not required. Only add options that lead to existing sections.

Rule 2: Don't delete others' stuff or link outside the README.md

Rule 3: Text only.
