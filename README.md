#### START
<pre>
You come across a cabin in the woods.
A creaking sound can be heard coming from inside.

[üî•](#arson-it-is) Begin your new life as an arsonist and burn the cabin to the ground.
<br>
[üö™](#that-was-a-horrible-decision) Enter through the front door.

#### Arson it is.
<pre>
You light a match and toss it towards the cabin.
The flames quickly catch and begin to devour the wooden structure.
The crackling of the fire is oddly satisfying as you watch the cabin burn to the ground.
</pre>
[ü•æ](#explore-the-forest-around-you) Explore the forest around you.

#### That was a _horrible_ decision.
<pre>
You cautiously push the creaky door open and step inside the cabin. The interior
is shrouded in darkness, illuminated only by faint beams of light that filter
through the boarded-up windows. The air is heavy with the scent of decay and
dampness. You hear strange noises echoing from the corners of the room, and your
heart starts racing. Every step you take seems to amplify the eerie atmosphere.
Suddenly, a cold gust of wind blows through the cabin, extinguishing the small
flashlight you brought with you. Panic sets in as you struggle to find your way
in the pitch-black darkness. You're trapped in the cabin with no way out, and a
feeling of dread consumes you.
</pre>
[üî¶](#search-for-a-way-out) Search for a source of light.
<br>
[üõãÔ∏è](#explore-the-darkness) Explore further into the darkness.

#### Explore the forest around you.
<pre>
You step out of the cabin and into the dense forest that surrounds it. The
sounds of rustling leaves and chirping birds fill the air. Shafts of sunlight
pierce through the canopy, creating dappled patterns on the ground. The forest
seems to stretch endlessly in all directions, and you feel a mix of excitement
and trepidation. As you venture deeper, you discover a narrow, overgrown path.
Following your curiosity, you decide to follow the path, wondering where it might
lead you. The journey ahead is unknown, but the sense of adventure beckons you
forward.
</pre>

#### Search for a way out.
<pre>
Your fingers trace along the walls, desperately searching for something to guide
you in the darkness. Your heart races as you feel your way around, hoping to find
a light switch or a window to the outside. After what feels like an eternity, your
hand brushes against a switch. With a flicker of hope, you turn it on, flooding
the cabin with dim light. The room reveals its eerie contents: dusty furniture,
cobwebs, and a sense of abandonment. Now that you can see, you notice a faint
outline of a door at the far end. You move towards it, eager to escape the ominous
interior.
</pre>

#### Explore the darkness.
<pre>
Your steps echo through the cabin as you venture deeper into the shadows. Each
creak of the floorboards sends a shiver down your spine. You slowly navigate the
room, your hands outstretched to avoid bumping into anything. Suddenly, you feel
something cold and damp brush against your fingertips. You recoil, heart racing,
as you realize it's a decaying piece of furniture covered in a layer of mold. As
you continue your exploration, the air grows heavier and the darkness more
oppressive. A feeling of dread envelops you, and you can't shake the sense that
you're not alone. Every instinct tells you to turn back, but a morbid curiosity
drives you to press on, deeper into the enigmatic darkness.
